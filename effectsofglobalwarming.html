            <p>Global warming is affecting life around the world and as a result, nature and wildlife are having to
              adapt to
              the new changes. Here are some of the effects of global warming that kids to should know:
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ice is melting at the North and South Poles, causing a lot of animals such as polar bears, seals and
                penguins
                to lose their habitat.</li>
              <li>The sea level has been rising more quickly over the last century. This can cause floods and endanger
                the
                lives of people living on the coast.</li>
              <li>We’re experiencing more extreme weather events, including storms, hurricanes and tornadoes. These are
                dangerous and they can injure people.</li>
              <li>We’re starting to experience hotter temperature. This can cause droughts and result in less water and
                food
                for people.</li>
              <li>Trees and plants are flowering much earlier in the year.</li>
              <li>Animal species are becoming endangered.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>According to <span class="w3-tag">Africa Development Bank (AfDB) Africa</span>, despite its low
              contribution to
              greenhouse gas emissions, remains the most vulnerable continent. Africa is the most vulnerable continent
              to
              climate change impacts under all climate scenarios above 1.5 degrees Celsius. Despite having contributed
              the
              least to global warming and having the lowest emissions, Africa faces exponential collateral damage,
              posing
              systemic risks to its economies, infrastructure investments, water and food systems, public health,
              agriculture,
              and livelihoods, threatening to undo its modest development gains and slip into higher levels of extreme
              poverty.
            </p>
            <p>Climate change is affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and
              affecting
              lives. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, and weather events are becoming more extreme.
              Saving
              lives and livelihoods requires urgent action to address the climate emergency.</p>
            <p>Seven of the 10 countries that are most vulnerable to climate change are in Africa. In 2015, four African
              countries ranked among the 10 countries most affected: Mozambique (1st), Malawi (3rd), Ghana and
              Madagascar
              (joint 8th position). Climate change represents a major threat to Africa achieving the Sustainable
              Development
              Goals. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report 2018 highlighted the grave consequences
              of a
              temperature increase above 1.5°C, especially for Africa. <span class="w3-tag">[Africa Development Bank at
                COP25]</span></p>
            <p>There is currently no global policy framework for addressing the needs and rights of children moving in
              the
              context of climate change. Where child-related migration policies do exist, they do not consider climate
              and
              environmental factors, and where climate change policies exist, they usually overlook children’s needs.

              Hello Children. My name is Dolapo Arogun. And I will like to take you on a journey to a cleaner energy
              future for
              mankind. Have you heard people on TVs talking about climate change? Ever wondered what it is and why we
              care
              about it so much? Well, I am here to help you understand what it all means, what is being done to address
              it and
              what we can all do to make a difference.

                <span>Global warming is the term used to describe the rising of the average temperature on Earth. It has
                  to do with the overall climate of the Earth rather than the weather on any given day.</span></a>

                <span class="w3-large">What causes Global Warming?</span><br />
                <span>Greenhouse gases are the biggest factor contributing to global warming. It’s important to know
                  that many of them occur naturally in the atmosphere.</span></a>

                <span>It is true that everyone is affected by climate change, but
                  children and young people in Africa will bear the brunt in the
                  coming decades, since the worst effects are expected mostly in
                  the second half of this century.</span></a>

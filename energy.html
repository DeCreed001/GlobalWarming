              There is a subtle difference between these two energy types even though they are often spoken of as being
              the
              same. Renewable energy is power generated from sources that are constantly being replenished. These
              renewable
              energy resources won’t run out, unlike fossil fuels and gas, and include wind and solar energy. However,
              while
              most green energy sources are renewable, not all renewable energy sources are seen as being green. For
              example,
              hydropower is a renewable resource, but some would argue that it is not green, since the deforestation and
              industrialization related to the building of hydro dams can damage the environment. The perfect clean
              energy mix
              occurs where green energy meets renewable energy, such as with solar energy and wind energy.
            </p>
            <p>Clean energy is energy gained from sources that do release air pollutants. Green energy is energy derived
              from
              natural sources such as the sun. Renewable energy comes from sources that are constantly being
              replenished, such
              as hydropower, wind power or solar energy.</p>

              Clean energy works by producing power without having negative environmental impacts, such as the release
              of
              greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. A lot of clean energy is also renewable, including wind power, some
              hydro
              resources and solar powered energy generation.</p>

              The most important aspect of clean energy are the environmental benefits as part of a global energy
              future. While
              clean, renewable resources also preserve the world’s natural resources, they also reduce the risk of
              environmental disasters, such as fuel spills or the problems associated with natural gas leaks.  With fuel
              diversification, through different power plants using different energy sources, it is possible to create
              reliable
              power supplies to enhance energy security, ensuring there is enough to meet our demands.</p>

              <li>Clean energy provides a variety of environmental and economic benefits, including a reduction in air
                pollution. A diverse clean energy supply also reduces the dependence on imported fuels (and the
                associated
                financial and environmental costs this incurs).</li>
              <li>Renewable clean energy also has inherent cost savings, as there is no need to extract and transport
                fuels,
                such as with oil or coal, as the resources replenish themselves naturally.</li>
              <li>Other industrial benefits of a clean energy mix are the creation of jobs to develop, manufacture and
                install
                the clean energy resources of the future.</li>

              wondered what it is and why we care about it so much? Well, I am
              here to help you understand what it all means, what is being
              done to address it and what we can all do to make a difference.

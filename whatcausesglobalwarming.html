							<h3><b>WHAT CAUSES GLOBAL WARMING?</b></h3>

							<p>Greenhouse gases are the biggest factor contributing to global warming. It’s important to know that many of them occur naturally in the atmosphere. In fact, without greenhouse gases, scientists estimate that the global temperature would be -18 °C.
							</p>
							<p>However, human activity is causing a lot more greenhouse gases and as a result, the earth’s temperature is increasing by too much. Here are just a few examples of how humans contribute to their increase:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Pollution - Fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil are used to make electricity and run cars. These fossil fuels are burnt in power stations and as a result, carbon dioxide is released into the air. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, and it’s very harmful to the environment.</li>
								<li>Deforestation - Huge areas of trees are being cut down for different reasons, such as using wood for fuel, building houses or factories. This contributes to global warming as there are fewer trees left to absorb carbon dioxide in the air.</li>
								<li>Water Vapour - Most water vapour ends up in the atmosphere in a natural way - for example, when water evaporates from the oceans and seas. However, human activities such as power plant cooling and flying can contribute to the creation of this greenhouse gas as well.</li>
								<li>Agriculture and Farming - We need food to survive, so farming is very important for us. However, animals such as cows, sheep, pigs and chickens release a greenhouse gas called methane, which is very harmful to the environment. To feed these animals, farmers use fertilizers and pesticides to help plants grow well. These cause even more greenhouse gases to be released.</li>
								<p>These are just a few of the many causes of global warming. It’s important to understand what we can do to decrease our negative impact on the planet.</p>

								Hello Children. My name is Dolapo Arogun. And I will like to take you on a journey to a cleaner energy future for mankind. Have you heard people on TVs talking about climate change? Ever wondered what it is and why we care about it so much? Well, I am here to help you understand what it all means, what is being done to address it and what we can all do to make a difference.

								<span>Global warming is the term used to describe the rising of the average temperature on Earth. It has to do with the overall climate of the Earth rather than the weather on any given day.</span></a>

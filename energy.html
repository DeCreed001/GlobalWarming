              There is a subtle difference between these two energy types even though they are often spoken of as being
              the
              same. Renewable energy is power generated from sources that are constantly being replenished. These
              renewable
              energy resources won’t run out, unlike fossil fuels and gas, and include wind and solar energy. However,
              while
              most green energy sources are renewable, not all renewable energy sources are seen as being green. For
              example,
              hydropower is a renewable resource, but some would argue that it is not green, since the deforestation and
              industrialization related to the building of hydro dams can damage the environment. The perfect clean
              energy mix
              occurs where green energy meets renewable energy, such as with solar energy and wind energy.
            </p>
            <p>Clean energy is energy gained from sources that do release air pollutants. Green energy is energy derived
              from
              natural sources such as the sun. Renewable energy comes from sources that are constantly being
              replenished, such
              as hydropower, wind power or solar energy.</p>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>
              Clean energy works by producing power without having negative environmental impacts, such as the release
              of
              greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. A lot of clean energy is also renewable, including wind power, some
              hydro
              resources and solar powered energy generation.</p>

            <h3><b>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</b></h3>
          </div>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>
              The most important aspect of clean energy are the environmental benefits as part of a global energy
              future. While
              clean, renewable resources also preserve the world’s natural resources, they also reduce the risk of
              environmental disasters, such as fuel spills or the problems associated with natural gas leaks.  With fuel
              diversification, through different power plants using different energy sources, it is possible to create
              reliable
              power supplies to enhance energy security, ensuring there is enough to meet our demands.</p>

            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clean energy provides a variety of environmental and economic benefits, including a reduction in air
                pollution. A diverse clean energy supply also reduces the dependence on imported fuels (and the
                associated
                financial and environmental costs this incurs).</li>
              <li>Renewable clean energy also has inherent cost savings, as there is no need to extract and transport
                fuels,
                such as with oil or coal, as the resources replenish themselves naturally.</li>
              <li>Other industrial benefits of a clean energy mix are the creation of jobs to develop, manufacture and
                install
                the clean energy resources of the future.</li>

              Everybody has a role to place in reducing the effects of climate and create a better future for the
              generation to
              come. We can work together to lower the amount of greenhouse gases we put into the atmosphere. This means
              using
              less energy! We can:

              <li>Turn off lights and electronics when not using them.</li>
              <li>Recycle and reuse products, since making new stuff requires more energy.</li>
              <li>Plant a tree. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air.</li>

                <span class="w3-large">What is Global Warming?</span><br />
                <span>Global warming is the term used to describe the rising of the
                  average global temperature of the Earth that started in the
                  pre-Industrial era due to the heating of the Earth’s surface.
                  The Earth’s warming trend has been going on for a very long
                  time, but the rate of warming has significantly increased in the
                  last century mainly due to human activities. Human activities
                  such as burning of fossil fuels to generate power and
                  manufacture goods are causing worldwide temperatures to rise
                  higher and faster than any time we know of in the past.</span></a>

                <span class="w3-large">Causes OF Global Warming?</span><br />
                <span>The main factor contributing to climate change is human
                  activities. This is because of the large number of greenhouse
                  gases we produce due to our lifestyle choices. Some greenhouse
                  gases occur naturally in the atmosphere and play a part in
                  making our planet habitable. However, the large number of
                  greenhouse gases we produce is too much for the environment to
                  handle.</span></a>

                <span class="w3-large">Effects of Global Warming?</span><br />
                <span>Warmer temperatures are gradually changing weather patterns and
                  disrupting the normal balance of nature. Some of these changes
                  such as heat waves, wildfires, prolonged drought, and extreme
                  rainfall are happening faster than scientists previously
                  predicted resulting in loss of lives, property damage and
                  population displacement. Extreme weather and climate change pose
                  many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth.</span></a>

                <span class="w3-large">Why should we care?</span><br />
                <span>Although climate change is affecting everyone, the concern is
                  its effects on future generations especially children and young
                  people in Africa who will most likely bear the brunt in the
                  coming decades. Scientists estimate that the worst is yet to
                  come and predict a warmer atmosphere and ocean if we do not
                  reduce emissions. If global warming is not stopped or slowed
                  down now, world economies could become stagnant as governments
                  and investors divert funding from critical services such as
                  health, education, nutrition, and other social services which
                  would yield benefits for future generations to mitigate the
                  climate crisis.</span></a>

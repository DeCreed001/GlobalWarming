								It’s true that everyone is affected by climate change, but
								children and young people in Africa will bear the brunt in the
								coming decades, since the worst effects are expected mostly in
								the second half of this century. By the mid-century, in 2050,
								the continent will be home to one billion children who, given
								the right life chances, could power an African social and
								economic renaissance.
							</p>
							<p>
								The climate crisis could scupper that. Over and above the direct
								impacts of floods, droughts, land and water conflicts,
								displacement and climate migration, carbon footprint, the
								consequences for employment, economic productivity and growth
								will be significant. Without meaningful action to reduce
								emissions in rich countries and to adapt development
								infrastructure and policies in Africa, declines in Gross
								Domestic Product (GDP) of up to 30 percent are predicted.

								Investments in essential services for children, such as early
								and basic education, health, nutrition and social protection –
								from which future generations would reap the benefits – are
								likely to be sidelined as governments, international donors and
								private investors divert funds to climate adaptation and
								mitigation.

								One of the speakers at the Africa Climate Week and COP 27, Dr.
								Joan Nyanyuki said “By the time the worst impacts of climate
								change are felt, many of those attending Africa Climate Week and
								COP 27 will be long gone. Despite their best intentions and
								calls for action, they have little skin in the game. It’s
								Africa’s children and young people who will be left to pick up
								the pieces as best they can. The sooner they are given a say in
								their own future, the better.”

							A Carbon Footprint is the total greenhouse gas emissions caused
							by something. Greenhouse gasses are what is making our planet
							warmer and causing climate change. Your carbon footprint is a
							number which shows the amount of carbon dioxide your greenhouse
							gas emissions equal.
						</p>
						<p>
							Places, companies, and events can have carbon footprints too.
							So, the school can have a carbon footprint made up from how much
							electricity it uses, the school dinners we eat and the items we
							use like paper and pens. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Anything that creates greenhouse gases can be included in your
							total carbon footprint. For example, a pen that was created in a
							factory that burns fossil fuels has a carbon footprint even if
							we can’t see the fossil fuels that were used when we look at a
							pen. It’s the same with food – a ham sandwich might not seem
							like it would have a carbon footprint but even things like
							transporting the ham from the farm to the shop will use fossil
							fuels.

							Carbon footprints can be increased by how we consume things such
							as food, transport usage, electricity, and gas. Some of the
							foods that produce the largest amount of carbon dioxide are
							beef, cheese, poultry and pork. Ways to reduce your carbon
							footprint It can be important for children to understand that
							the decisions they make can have an effect on their environment.
							This may inspire them to do more to protect their environment
							and also develop a feeling of responsibility that will cross
							into other areas of their lives. There are also lots of things
							children can do individually to reduce their carbon footprint,
							thereby empowering them to protect their environment.

						<h3><b>WHAT ARE THE WAYS TO REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT?</b></h3>

					<div class="w3-container">
						<p>
							Since there are myriads of ways to increase the carbon footprint, it follows that there must
							be various ways to reduce the carbon footprints as well. here are some of those ways:
						</p>
						<p>
						<ul>
							<li>use reusable water bottles</li>
							<li>turn off lights not being used: Make sure you turn off the lights in the classroom
								before you go to lunch, don’t leave the oven on for an hour before you put your pizza in
								and try and find ways to use less electricity. The good thing about electricity is one
								day it might all be made from wind power and tidal power which means that no carbon
								emissions are pumped out. At the moment 46% of electricity comes from eco-friendly
								energy – these are known as renewable resources.</li>
							<li>walk to school instead of being driven: Instead of driving a vehicle that uses fossil
								fuels and walk or cycle to school. That will keep you keep healthy and the environment
								will thank you.</li>
							<li>go camping instead of flying to an international destination</li>
							<li>make gifts instead of buying them: Everything we do creates emissions, then choosing to
								use a bag we already have instead of buying a new one, playing with a toy we have and
								repairing things that are broken instead of replacing them can have a really reduce our
								carbon footprint.</li>
							<li>use paper or reusable straws: Clothes create a lot of carbon emissions when they are
								made, plus some fabrics like polyester are made from plastic which means they release
								little pieces of plastic into the oceans when they are washed and pollute the sea.</li>
							<li>By buying a secondhand cloth instead of a new one you are stopping a brand-new item
								being made and not adding to your carbon footprint.</li>
							<li>Plant a tree: Trees breathe in CO2 and turn it into oxygen – plant a tree and you can
								help suck that carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere!</li>
							<li>Reduce how much meat you eat/ go veggie: Food’s carbon footprint is the greenhouse gas
								emissions produced by growing, rearing, farming, processing, transporting, storing,
								cooking and disposing of the food you eat. Meat, especially lamb and beef, has a high
								carbon footprint.  It is estimated a vegetarian diet has half the carbon footprint of a
								meat eater’s diet and that vegans have the lowest carbon footprint of all diets.  Think
								about eating less meat – maybe have a veggie school dinner option instead of meat or
								find ways to reduce the meat you put into something by adding an extra vegetable to your
								meal like a sweet potato. If vegetables are locally grown that’s even better because it
								will have less transportation emissions.</li>
